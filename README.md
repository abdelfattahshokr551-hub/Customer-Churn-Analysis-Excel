🚀 Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Excel

I recently completed a project analyzing customer churn for a fictitious telecom company, Databel, using Excel.

🔍 What I did:

Cleaned and prepared the dataset.

Built calculated columns and PivotTables to explore churn drivers.

Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize key insights.

📊 Key Findings:

1-Overall churn rate: 26.9%.

2-Highest churn rates were seen in states like CA (75%) and IN (66.7%).

3-Contract type and data usage played a big role in churn behavior.

4-Competitors attracted customers mainly with better offers (44%) and higher download speeds (27%).

5-Senior customers showed a higher churn rate compared to younger ones.

✨ Takeaway:

 Understanding why customers churn is critical. This analysis highlights that targeted retention strategies — like competitive offers and loyalty incentives — can significantly reduce churn.
